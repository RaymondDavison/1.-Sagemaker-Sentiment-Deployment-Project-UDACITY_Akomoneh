# Sagemaker-Sentiment-Deployment-Project-UDACITY
 Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App Using PyTorch and SageMaker
This notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used SageMaker to construct a complete project from end to end. The goal of this project is to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to my deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
### Project Instruction
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	git clone https://github.com/ayowolet/Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
Open the SageMaker Project.ipynb file. Of course, you can find HTML version of the file.
	jupyter notebook SageMaker Proejct.ipynb
Read and follow the instructions! You can find and download the dataset for this project in the notebook.
