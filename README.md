# Sagemaker-Sentiment-Deployment-Project-UDACITY
 Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App Using PyTorch and SageMaker
This notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used SageMaker to construct a complete project from end to end. The goal of this project is to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to my deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
## Frameworks
